# Edge-Contour-Detection-using-Computer-Vision
This project is an image processing application to detect edges in an image. This project provides an implementation of the algorithm from scratch in Python using the OpenCV library. By utilizing this project, users can apply edge detection to their images and visualize the detected edges at different stages of the algorithm's application.
