# Edge-Contour-Detection-using-Computer-Vision
This project is an image processing application to detect edges in an image. This project provides an implementation of the algorithm from scratch in Python using the OpenCV library. By utilizing this project, users can apply edge detection to their images and visualize the detected edges at different stages of the algorithm's application.

# Canny Edge Detection
This project is an implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm in Python using the OpenCV library. The Canny edge detection algorithm is a widely used technique for identifying edges in images. This repository provides an application that allows users to apply the Canny edge detection algorithm to their images.

# Usage
Run the .ipynb file and place your input image's path in the image directory.:

Adjust the parameters in the detect_edges.py file as needed to fine-tune the edge detection.

The output image with detected edges can be viewed by running the cells.
